<p>1. Aryabhata (476–550 CE)
Contributions: Aryabhata is often regarded as one of the most important mathematicians and astronomers of ancient India. His work Aryabhatiya includes remarkable contributions to algebra, trigonometry, and geometry.
He introduced the concept of zero as a placeholder and made significant advancements in number theory.
He calculated the value of π (pi) to be approximately 3.1416, and the value of sin for various angles.</p>
<p>2. Brahmagupta (598–668 CE)
Contributions: Brahmagupta is known for his work Brahmasphutasiddhanta, which contains solutions to linear and quadratic equations.
He is credited with the discovery of the concept of negative numbers and zero as a number, and he developed rules for arithmetic operations involving zero and negative numbers.
Brahmagupta also formulated methods for solving diophantine equations (equations with integer solutions) and is considered one of the early pioneers in algebra. </p> 
<p>3. Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887–1920)
Contributions: Though Ramanujan lived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, his work continues to be a defining influence in modern mathematics. He developed many profound and original results in number theory, infinite series, continued fractions, and modular forms.
He was self-taught and produced results that were far ahead of his time. His Ramanujan-Hardy number (172) and the Ramanujan prime are well-known, and his work on partition functions and mock theta functions has had a lasting impact on modern mathematics.</p>
