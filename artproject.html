<p>Warli art is a traditional tribal art form that originates from the Warli tribes of Maharashtra, India. Known for its simple yet striking visual language, it uses geometric shapes like circles, triangles, and squares to depict scenes of daily life, nature, animals, and human figures. The paintings are usually created with white pigment on a mud base, highlighting the connection between humans and their environment. Warli art is deeply symbolic, often conveying themes of harmony with nature, community life, and spiritual beliefs</p>
